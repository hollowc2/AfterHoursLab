# AfterHoursLab

A read-only market-data lab application. It has no Schwab credentials of its own and
never will — all market data comes exclusively from the standalone internal gateway at
[hollowc2/SchwabGateway](https://github.com/hollowc2/SchwabGateway) over its HTTP API
(`/v1/quotes`, `/v1/spot`, `/v1/chain`), authenticated with a pre-issued internal API key.

This app is registered in the gateway's auth model as:

- application id: `afterhours-lab`
- capability: `market_data:read`
- priority class: `background`

There is no order, account, position, or streaming code here, and none will be added —
those routes don't exist on the gateway and are out of scope for this app.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `SCHWAB_GATEWAY_URL` and
`SCHWAB_GATEWAY_API_KEY` with values for a real, already-issued gateway key. This app
does not and cannot issue its own key — key issuance is an explicitly-approved operator
action on the SchwabGateway side:

```bash
schwab-gateway-issue-keys --application-id afterhours-lab --capability market_data:read --priority background
```

That command runs against the SchwabGateway repo, not this one, and is out of scope for
this repo's scaffolding.

## Development

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
```

## Smoke test

Once `SCHWAB_GATEWAY_URL` and `SCHWAB_GATEWAY_API_KEY` are set in the environment:

```bash
uv run afterhours-lab-smoke
```

This fetches a spot quote for `$SPX` through the gateway and prints the validated
response. It exits non-zero and logs a clear message on any gateway client error
(authentication, authorization, timeout, capacity, or unavailability).
